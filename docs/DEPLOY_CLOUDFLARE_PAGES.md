# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

This app is a Blazor WebAssembly app with Cloudflare Pages Functions for personal encrypted user-data sync and shared party CRON sync. Cloudflare Pages can build the app from GitHub and serve the published static files from the `*.pages.dev` domain.

## Repository files

- `build.sh` - installs the pinned .NET SDK, installs npm dependencies, syncs vendored Dexie, and publishes the Blazor WebAssembly app.
- `.node-version` - asks Cloudflare Pages to use Node.js 22.
- `functions/api/sync/[syncId].js` - Cloudflare Pages Function for encrypted sync uploads and downloads.
- `functions/api/party-sync/[partyId].js` - Cloudflare Pages Function for shared party CRON data, protected by live Habitica party-membership verification.
- `migrations/0001_party_sync.sql` - D1 schema for party state, CRON events, and placeholder quest queue/vote tables.
- `wrangler.toml` - local/dev binding declarations for KV and D1.

## Cloudflare Pages settings

Use these settings when creating the Pages project:

```text
Framework preset: None
Build command: ./build.sh
Build output directory: output/wwwroot
Root directory: repository root
Production branch: main
Deploy command: leave empty
```

The build script installs .NET SDK `8.0.125` by default to match `global.json`. Override it only if `global.json` is updated in the same change.

Do not set `npx wrangler deploy` as the deploy command for the Git-connected Pages project. That command deploys a Worker and does not know which static output directory to publish. Cloudflare Pages should publish the configured `output/wwwroot` directory after `build.sh` finishes.

## Cloudflare sync storage

Personal encrypted sync requires a KV namespace bound to the Pages project.

1. In Cloudflare, open `Workers & Pages`.
2. Open `KV`.
3. Create a namespace, for example `habitica_companion_sync`.
4. Open the Pages project settings.
5. Open `Bindings`.
6. Add a KV namespace binding:

   ```text
   Variable name: HABITICA_SYNC_KV
   KV namespace: habitica_companion_sync
   ```

7. Add the same binding for preview and production environments if you use both.

The personal sync Pages Function stores only encrypted payloads. Habitica User ID and API Token are used in the browser to derive the encryption key and sync id; they are not sent to the personal sync endpoint.
When the app refreshes Habitica data or completes supported local data changes, it automatically downloads the existing encrypted bundle, merges it with local portable data, and uploads the merged bundle back to this KV namespace.

Shared party sync requires a D1 database bound to the Pages project.

1. In Cloudflare, open `Workers & Pages`.
2. Open `D1 SQL Database`.
3. Create a database, for example `habitica-companion-party-sync`.
4. Apply `migrations/0001_party_sync.sql`.
5. Open the Pages project settings.
6. Open `Bindings`.
7. Add a D1 database binding:

   ```text
   Variable name: HABITICA_PARTY_DB
   D1 database: habitica-companion-party-sync
   ```

8. Add `HABITICA_X_CLIENT_HEADER` as an environment variable or secret for the Functions runtime.

The party sync Function receives the caller's Habitica credentials only to verify current party membership with Habitica before read/write access. It stores shared party CRON history and derived party state in D1. Do not authorize party sync by `partyId` alone.

## First deployment

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In Cloudflare, open `Workers & Pages`.
3. Create a Pages application and import the GitHub repository.
4. Use the build settings listed above.
5. Add this environment variable if you want a production Habitica `x-client` value available to the frontend and Pages Functions:

   ```text
   HABITICA_X_CLIENT_HEADER=your-habitica-user-id-habitica-tool
   ```

   This value is public in the deployed frontend. Do not put Habitica API tokens, passwords, or private keys in Cloudflare Pages environment variables for this static app.

6. Save and deploy.
7. Open the generated `https://<project>.pages.dev` URL.
8. Check a routed page refresh, for example `https://<project>.pages.dev/tasks`.
9. In Settings, use `Upload` under encrypted Cloudflare sync. If the KV binding is missing, the upload will fail with a `HABITICA_SYNC_KV binding is not configured` error. If the D1 binding is missing, shared party sync is skipped and logged as a warning.

## Local Functions testing

Use Wrangler Pages dev for local Function parity with KV and D1 bindings:

```text
wrangler pages dev output/wwwroot
```

Create local KV/D1 resources or override the placeholder IDs in `wrangler.toml` before relying on local persistence.

## Existing browser migration

Older deployments registered a service worker and used a `_redirects` file. Current deployments rely on Cloudflare Pages native SPA behavior and do not register a service worker. Existing users should unregister the old service worker, clear site data, and hard refresh once after redeploy.

## Updates

Push to the production branch and Cloudflare Pages will rebuild automatically.

## Operational notes

- A custom domain is optional. The generated `*.pages.dev` domain works for HTTPS testing.
- The app must be served from the site root with `base href="/"`. Subpath hosting is not the baseline deployment target.
- Personal sync keeps Habitica credentials in the browser and stores only encrypted KV blobs.
- Shared party sync sends credentials to the Pages Function for live Habitica membership verification and stores shared party data in D1.
- `service-worker*.js` files may remain in the repo, but `index.html` does not register them.
