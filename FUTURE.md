# Future Work

Last validated: 2026-06-08.

This is the single implementation queue. Historical source plans were merged here and removed after implemented items were filtered out. Entries higher in the file are higher priority; finish them first.

Implemented behavior belongs in `FEATURES.md`, foundational architecture notes in `TECHNICAL.md`, Habitica endpoint rules in `HABITICA_API.md`, and UI guidance in `docs/UX_UI_MANIFEST.md`. Delete an entry from this file when it ships.

## Implementor Rules

1. Read the relevant source-of-truth docs before editing:
   - UI/UX: `docs/UX_UI_MANIFEST.md`
   - Architecture, sync, storage: `TECHNICAL.md`
   - Habitica API rules: `HABITICA_API.md`
   - Habitica party/quest link behavior: `docs/HABITICA_DEEPLINKS.md`
   - Cloudflare deployment and D1/KV: `docs/DEPLOY_CLOUDFLARE_PAGES.md`
2. Implement one entry only. Do not bundle unrelated cleanup, renames, or opportunistic refactors.
3. If a task lists `Touch:`, edit only those paths and direct tests unless the task explicitly permits more.
4. Add or update tests next to affected code. UI behavior changes need Razor component tests where similar tests exist.
5. User-facing behavior changes must update `FEATURES.md`; sync architecture or backend behavior changes must update `TECHNICAL.md`.
6. Schema changes need the next numbered migration under `migrations/` and a deployment-doc update.
7. Never send Habitica API tokens to Cloudflare party-sync or app-data sync endpoints.
8. Keep labels short and plain. If UI copy is ambiguous, choose the smallest clear label and proceed.
9. If a needed Habitica endpoint is not documented in `HABITICA_API.md`, stop and add a follow-up entry instead of guessing.
10. For Habitica party/quest links, use stable web URLs only. Do not add `habitica://`, Android `intent://`, app-opening probes, or mobile-app-specific party/quest links unless `docs/HABITICA_DEEPLINKS.md` is updated with new official support.
11. When interacting with this file, process `Pending to be added to Prioritized Next Changes` before starting implementation work. Move one pending item at a time into `Prioritized Next Changes`, either as a new self-contained entry or merged into an existing matching entry, then remove the moved item from pending. Keep `Top` additions before current prioritized entries, `Middle` additions after all `Top` additions and before current prioritized entries, and `Bottom` additions at the bottom of `Prioritized Next Changes`.

- Dashboard and Spells CRON blocks expose compact due unfinished-Daily mini lists with guarded inline completion.
- Spells sticky current-mana bar with available MP, max MP, class, and persistent scroll visibility above spell cards.
- App color scheme system with centralized semantic tokens, Alpha/Habitica/Gryphy built-in schemes, Settings picker, custom editable schemes, shell/button/disabled/input theming, mobile localStorage fallback, fast local reload persistence, and portable sync storage.
- Random color scheme controls: shared color-scheme panel on Settings, Dashboard, and Sign-in, random-preset pick from built-in plus custom schemes, fully-random theme generation with a chaos slider (Calm to Madness) scaling hue/saturation divergence, held as a session-only pending theme (selectable via a "Generated" dropdown entry, applied without persisting), naming/saving the last random theme into custom schemes, and copy/paste of presets for building fully custom palettes.
- Quests-page quest pool expanded by default with an in-memory manual collapse control.
- Party-page combined summary and bottom-grouped sync administration; active quests compact participant and unavailable-finish-estimate rendering.
- Quest-pool search by public reward display name, including partial case-insensitive matches.
- Active-quest owner/starter and started-at metadata with shared-queue fallback, unavailable states, and foldable details/rewards and participant-name drill-ins.
- Post-CRON party refresh now saves enriched party snapshots with CRON history, member average timing, active-quest progress, and completion estimates before reloading state, so `/quests` can show finish predictions immediately after Start New Day.
- Incoming damage prediction now lives only inside the Dashboard Start New Day panel, uses confirmed-due unfinished Dailies for numeric totals, separates unknown due-state Dailies into collapsed details, includes active boss pending damage once for current-user CRON risk, and keeps the standalone Dashboard damage card removed.
- Dedicated Pets & Mounts page with grouped companion grids, feed queue planner, hatching and equip actions, local fold preferences, and relocated bulk sell planner while keeping per-pet/per-mount maps out of Cloudflare app-data uploads.
- Dashboard gem-for-gold purchase action with visible availability states, no-subscription Subscribe link, quantity clamp, explicit confirmation, sequential stop-on-failure requests, diagnostics, and post-purchase account refresh.
- Party page overview no longer shows the buff-timing recommendation block, while member review, CRON graph context, and Quests workspace remain intact.
- Manual task arrangement now persists locally and triggers a narrow encrypted upload of the task-order cloud-sync section without blocking or undoing local reorder changes.
- Random theme generation now guards calm/moderate card text and primary/secondary filled-button label contrast across generated gradient stops, with readability thresholds intentionally relaxed only toward high-chaos Madness output.
- Persisted appearance changes now request a narrow encrypted upload of the color-schemes cloud-sync section, while transient random themes, rerolls, chaos changes, and paste previews stay local until saved; Appearance close actions read `Done` unless they truly discard a preview/edit.
- Healer Blessing estimates now use concise per-member HP copy, keep fresh-HP capping and aggregate scoring, and no longer expose group-total HP wording.
- Inventory page user-facing labels now read Equipment across drawer navigation, page title, dashboard link, tests, and user-facing docs while preserving the `/inventory` route and inventory data/API terminology.
- Spell cards now support Spend All Mana count planning, a cancellable one-second Preparing stage, card-local Cancel for active cast runs, cancellation-aware sequential spell execution, and a 350 ms default Habitica API minimum request spacing without adding an appsettings override.
- Party member status now has local display-name search that trims whitespace, matches partial names case-insensitively, composes with class filtering and sort order, shows a clearable no-match state, and avoids API requests while typing.

## Pending Queue

### Queued items to be added to `Prioritized Next Changes`

Work top to bottom. This is an intake list for rough notes that must become self-contained `Prioritized Next Changes` entries before implementation. Preserve the `Priority Instructions` and `Entries` structure.

### Priority Instructions

- Top – add to the top of the `Prioritized Next Changes` list (max priority).
- Middle – right after the `Top` entries and before current `Prioritized Next Changes` list items.
- Bottom – (default) the lowest priority entries, add to the bottom of the `Prioritized Next Changes` list.

### Entries:

_No pending entries._

## Prioritized Next Changes

Work top to bottom. Each entry is self-contained.

### Improve Blessing Effect Preview Wording And Low-Value Healing Warnings

Priority: Bottom (default from pending queue).

Goal: make Healer Blessing preview understandable by showing per-member healing first, keeping aggregate party healing out of default copy, and warning when party HP is already high enough that most healing would have little or no effect.

Touch:
- `src/Habitica.Rules/Spells/SpellViewModelFactory.cs`
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/Pages/SpellsPage.razor`
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/wwwroot/css/app.css` only if new warning or details styling is needed
- direct tests under `tests/Habitica.Rules.Tests/Spells/SpellViewModelFactoryTests.cs`
- direct tests under `tests/Habitica.WebApp.Tests/Pages/SpellsPageTests.cs`
- `FEATURES.md`
- `HABITICA_API.md` if official Blessing formula, stat inputs, or source-backed limitations are added or corrected
- `docs/UX_UI_MANIFEST.md` if spell-card preview wording, warning placement, or density guidance changes

Out of scope:
- changing the Blessing formula solely for wording;
- hiding or disabling the Cast button only because healing is inefficient;
- changing cast execution order, Spend All Mana behavior, CRON warning behavior, or dynamic gear recommendation selection;
- exposing aggregate party-wide HP restored as the primary user-facing value;
- inventing effective healing for party members with stale or missing HP data.

Source checks before implementation:
- Inspect current official Habitica source for the Healer `healAll` / Blessing spell formula and target semantics.
- Verify whether formula inputs include Intelligence, Constitution, buffed stats, level bonus, equipment preview stats, cast count, and per-member missing-HP cap.
- Inspect current project code for Blessing spell metadata, preview model fields, party HP coverage, stale/fresh party snapshot logic, multi-cast calculation, auto-equip stat preview, Spend All Mana count planning, and number formatting.
- Do not change formula output unless the official/source check shows current local behavior is wrong.

Implementation plan:
1. Split Blessing preview data into explicit values where needed: raw heal per member per cast, raw heal per member total, covered member count, full-value member count, partial-value member count, no-effect member count, effective heal total, fresh-party-health flag, stale/unknown HP flag, limited-value warning, and no-healing-needed warning.
2. Keep source-backed raw per-member healing as the primary line. For one cast, render approximately X HP per party member. For multiple casts, render X HP per party member per cast plus total for N casts per party member.
3. When fresh party HP is available, cap each member's effective healing by missing HP. Do not claim every member receives the full raw total when capped.
4. Add deterministic warning classification. Show a limited-value warning when more than half of covered members would receive partial or no value. Show a stronger low-need warning when at least 80% are capped/no-effect or total effective healing is near zero. Show `No meaningful healing is needed right now.` when all covered members receive no effect.
5. If party HP is stale, unavailable, or partially missing, show raw per-member healing plus a concise uncertainty note. Keep detailed coverage in expanded details only if still useful.
6. Update `SpellsPage.razor` to format model state rather than infer warning behavior from strings. Preserve locale-aware decimal formatting.
7. Style warning text with existing theme-aware warning styles. Warnings should be near the Cast button and should not look like fatal errors.
8. Recalculate preview and warnings when cast count changes, Spend All Mana changes count, auto-equip recommendation changes stats, party HP refreshes, mana changes, and spell casts complete.
9. Update docs only for visible behavior or verified formula semantics that change.

Default copy direction:
- One useful cast: `Restores approximately X HP per party member.`
- Multiple useful casts: `Restores approximately X HP per party member per cast.` and `Total for N casts: approximately Y HP per party member.`
- Fresh HP capping: `Effective healing may be lower for members already near full HP.`
- More than half capped/no-effect: `Healing value is limited because most covered members are already near full HP.`
- Low need: `Party HP is already high. Blessing is probably not needed right now.`
- No effect: `No meaningful healing is needed right now.`
- Missing HP data: `Some party HP data is unavailable, so effective healing may differ.`

Acceptance:
- Blessing preview no longer uses confusing `0-X HP per covered party member` wording as the primary line.
- Default preview no longer shows aggregate party HP restored as the main value.
- One-cast preview says approximately how much HP is restored per party member.
- Multi-cast preview says approximately how much HP is restored per party member per cast and for all selected casts.
- Effective healing caps are still respected when fresh party HP is available.
- More than half of covered members being capped/no-effect shows a limited-value warning.
- All or almost all covered members being healthy shows a stronger low-need warning.
- All covered members receiving no effect shows a no-meaningful-healing warning.
- Unknown or stale party HP data produces concise uncertainty copy without invented effective healing.
- Cast action remains available unless normal casting rules disable it.
- Warning and preview text are theme-aware, readable, and close to the cast decision.
- Decimal formatting remains consistent with the rest of the app.
- Official/source verification confirms the formula or records why the estimate remains approximate.

Tests:
- Add or update spell preview model tests for one Blessing cast with useful healing, multiple casts with useful healing, all members missing enough HP for full value, more than half near full HP, almost all near full HP, all full HP, mixed full/partial/no-effect members, unknown party HP data, stale party HP data, auto-equip changing healing value, Spend All Mana changing count, and locale-aware decimal formatting.
- Add or update Spells page tests for new primary wording, multi-cast per-member total wording, limited-value warning, no-healing-needed warning, no aggregate party HP total in default preview, cast action staying available during low-value warning, and expanded details if aggregate/member coverage remains available.
- Keep tests focused on changed behavior and direct dependencies.

## Backlog

These entries are lower priority. Each entry is self-contained and should be promoted into `Prioritized Next Changes` before implementation.

### Party Quest Workspace Modes

Goal: separate the Party page's current quest, shared queue planning, quest pool, recent completions, and member/CRON sections into clearer scan modes.

Touch:
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/Pages/PartyPage.razor`
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/wwwroot/css/app.css`
- direct tests under `tests/Habitica.WebApp.Tests/Pages/PartyPageTests.cs`
- `FEATURES.md`
- `docs/UX_UI_MANIFEST.md` if shared navigation or mode guidance changes

Out of scope:
- changing party-sync data contracts;
- adding new quest analytics;
- changing Habitica party or quest links.

Acceptance:
- Party page provides a tab or segmented mode switch for current quest, planning, history, and members/CRON.
- Existing actions keep their current authorization and stale-data guards.
- Empty and offline cached states remain visible in the relevant mode.
- Component tests cover mode switching and at least one guarded action still rendering in its mode.

### Party Quest History Analytics

Goal: summarize stored shared quest completion history beyond the current recent-completion cards and queue penalty labels.

Touch:
- `src/Habitica.Domain/Party`
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/Pages/PartyPage.razor`
- `functions/api/party-sync/[partyId].js` only if the existing recent-completion payload is not enough
- direct tests under `tests/`
- `FEATURES.md`

Out of scope:
- collecting Habitica data that is not already available through current snapshots, chat completion signals, or shared queue records;
- optional vote budgets;
- changing quest queue ordering.

Acceptance:
- History view shows aggregate completions by quest and by owner from available shared history.
- Analytics clearly state the covered time window and when data is unavailable or sparse.
- Existing recent-completion removal permissions remain unchanged.
- Tests cover aggregate calculations and sparse/no-history rendering.

### Skill Macro Collection MVP

Goal: implement a local macro collection for predefined equipment and skill sequences.

Touch:
- proposed new `src/Habitica.Rules/Skills` area
- `src/Habitica.Application`
- `src/Habitica.WebApp`
- direct tests under `tests/`
- `FEATURES.md`
- `TECHNICAL.md` if storage or execution architecture changes

Out of scope:
- arbitrary user code execution;
- loops or unbounded repeat-until macros;
- storing credentials in exported macros;
- server-side macro execution.

Primary data:
- current user snapshot;
- current task snapshot;
- current equipment snapshot;
- current party/quest snapshot;
- local equipment presets;
- owned gear catalog;
- available skill metadata.

Expected outputs:
- compiled macro plan;
- dry-run preview;
- mana cost estimate;
- expected result estimate where current formulas support it;
- ordered Habitica API execution steps;
- validation warnings;
- execution log.

Storage model:
- add macro collection, macro, macro-step, dry-run, execution-log, and execution-step-log records through the existing local storage abstractions;
- reference existing per-user Equipment battle preset ids instead of copying preset slot mappings into macro definitions;
- persist partial execution state after every step.

Macro model:
- macros are declarative, named sequences, not executable user code;
- initial step types are `equip`, `cast`, `selectBestTask`, `assertManaAtLeast`, `assertCurrentClass`, `refreshSnapshot`, `stopIfWarning`, and `restoreOriginalGear`;
- spell references use stable Habitica spell ids, with text shorthand such as `spell:fireball`, `spell:pickPocket`, and `spell:healAll`;
- structured cast steps use an explicit shape such as `{ "action": "castSpell", "spellId": "fireball", "targetTaskId": "task-id", "count": 1 }`;
- task-targeting spells may use an explicit `targetTaskId` or a `selectBestTask` result;
- dynamic spell equipment recommendations are strategies such as `maximize:int`, `maximize:per`, or `balanced:int,per`, compiled against the current gear snapshot at execution time;
- dynamic gear recommendations must not be saved as generated preset ids.

Equip references:
- preset id;
- single gear item key;
- best-gear query such as maximize perception or maximize strength;
- restore original battle gear or costume captured when the macro starts.

Selection UX:
- list matching presets first, then individual owned gear items;
- preset labels include kind, name, and battle preset stat totals when available;
- individual gear labels use the Equipment gear catalog display name with raw key fallback.

Example macro:
```text
1. Equip gear that maximizes perception.
2. Cast Tools of the Trade 3 times.
3. Equip gear that maximizes strength.
4. Cast Backstab until there is no mana left.
5. Restore gear that was equipped before the macro started.
```

Execution flow:
```text
1. Load macro definition.
2. Compile into explicit steps.
3. Validate against latest snapshot.
4. Produce dry-run preview.
5. Require user confirmation.
6. Execute one step at a time through Habitica.Api.
7. After each mutating step, update local state or refresh relevant data.
8. Stop on unexpected state, API error, insufficient mana, or rate-limit delay requiring user-visible wait.
9. Persist execution log.
```

Restore rules:
- snapshot original battle gear and costume gear before the first mutating step when any restore action is present;
- restore actions use the captured start state, not currently edited preset definitions.

Validation:
- reject unknown step types;
- reject missing task targets;
- reject unavailable gear;
- reject deleted equipment preset references;
- reject plans that exceed available mana at dry-run time;
- reject unsupported class skills;
- reject destructive decisions based on stale data;
- reject unbounded loops.

Error handling:
- stop by default when an API call fails;
- show completed steps;
- show failed step;
- show whether local state may be stale;
- offer manual refresh.

Security:
- macros must not store credentials;
- exported macros must not include user API tokens, raw API headers, or private snapshots unless explicitly exported as a debug bundle.

Pre-implementation checks:
- confirm each skill endpoint and target semantic against `HABITICA_API.md` and current Habitica API docs before execution support is enabled.

Acceptance:
- Users can create, edit, delete, and run local declarative macros using the initial step types listed in this task.
- Dry-run preview shows planned equipment changes, selected targets, mana cost, expected requests, warnings, and stop conditions.
- Execution runs sequentially, persists progress, refreshes or updates local state after mutating steps, and stops on validation failures, API errors, stale state, or unexpected state changes.
- Macro steps can reference existing Equipment battle preset ids and dynamic gear strategies without copying transient recommendation data.
- Tests cover parsing/validation, missing gear, insufficient mana, stale data, deleted preset references, preset-first gear selection, task target resolution, restore-original-gear behavior, partial execution failure, stop-on-failure, and rate-limit response handling.

### Task Mutation Dry-Run Summaries

Goal: add stronger pre-action summaries for existing task scoring/checkoff controls where local data can make the mutation clearer.

Touch:
- `src/Habitica.Api`
- `src/Habitica.Application`
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/Pages/TasksPage.razor`
- direct tests under `tests/`
- `HABITICA_API.md` if endpoint response assumptions are added or corrected
- `FEATURES.md`

Out of scope:
- duplicating spell estimates, Dashboard pending-damage/health-potion helpers, Inventory equip deltas, or bulk-sell previews;
- adding undocumented Habitica mutation endpoints;
- claiming exact GP/XP/HP deltas unless the value comes from a live API response or a documented formula.

Acceptance:
- Task cards show a concise dry-run summary for supported scoring/checkoff actions before multi-score or ambiguous mutations execute.
- Summaries distinguish exact API-returned values, local estimates, and unavailable values.
- Multi-score habit actions still run sequentially and stop on failure.
- Tests cover summary rendering, stale-data blocking, and unavailable-estimate copy.

### Settings Danger Zone Confirmation

Goal: require an explicit confirmation step before clearing local browser data from Settings.

Touch:
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/Pages/SettingsPage.razor`
- direct tests under `tests/Habitica.WebApp.Tests/Pages/`
- `FEATURES.md`

Out of scope:
- changing the data actually cleared by `ClearLocalDataAsync()`;
- adding new import/export behavior.

Acceptance:
- Clear Local Data opens or reveals a confirmation that names credentials, cached Habitica data, party history, diagnostics, and setup data.
- The destructive action does not call `ClearLocalDataAsync()` until the confirmation control is activated.
- Cancel/close keeps local data untouched.
- Tests cover initial click, cancellation, and confirmed clearing.

### Returning User Copy Compression

Goal: reduce repeated hero/help copy for authenticated returning users while keeping first-run empty states understandable.

Touch:
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/Pages`
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/wwwroot/css/app.css`
- direct page tests under `tests/Habitica.WebApp.Tests/Pages/`
- `docs/UX_UI_MANIFEST.md` if shared copy rules change

Out of scope:
- redesigning navigation;
- removing first-run or unauthenticated guidance;
- changing data loading behavior.

Acceptance:
- Returning authenticated users see denser top sections on Dashboard, Tasks, Party, Equipment, and Spells.
- First-run, signed-out, stale-data, and empty-cache states still explain the next action.
- Tests cover at least one authenticated returning state and one unauthenticated/empty state.

### Mobile Stat Table Context

Goal: keep row labels visible or repeated when wide stat tables scroll horizontally on small screens.

Touch:
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/wwwroot/css/app.css`
- pages using `.stats-table`
- direct tests under `tests/Habitica.WebApp.Tests/Pages/` if markup changes
- `docs/UX_UI_MANIFEST.md` if table guidance changes

Out of scope:
- replacing table data with cards across desktop;
- changing stat calculations.

Acceptance:
- Mobile-width stat tables keep row identity visible through a sticky first column or repeated row-label context.
- Horizontal scrolling remains available for dense table values.
- Desktop table layout remains unchanged except for harmless label-context support.

### Compact Spell Card Density Pass

Goal: make spell cards easier to scan after the current full-card layout, recommendations, and CRON warning flow have been exercised.

Touch:
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/Pages/SpellsPage.razor`
- `src/Habitica.WebApp/wwwroot/css/app.css`
- direct tests under `tests/Habitica.WebApp.Tests/Pages/SpellsPageTests.cs`
- `FEATURES.md`

Out of scope:
- changing spell estimate formulas;
- changing dynamic gear recommendation selection;
- changing cast execution order or CRON-warning semantics.

Acceptance:
- Spell cards keep target selection, count, mana preview, cast action, estimate text, CRON warning, and equipment recommendations available.
- Repeated low-priority explanatory copy is collapsed, summarized, or moved behind local detail affordances.
- Active casting progress and errors remain prominent.
- Tests cover key controls still rendering after the density change.
