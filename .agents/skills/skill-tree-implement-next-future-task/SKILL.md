# Skill-Tree: Implement Next Task

Flavor: web. Read the [concrete project profile](references/project-profile.md).

Read repository-owner rules before action. Exact prioritized selection, required dependency scope, checkpoint integrity, truthful evidence, owner authorization and commit/publication boundaries remain mandatory. A profile, installed flavor or stored checkpoint grants no execution or continuation permission. Read [validation policy](references/validation-policy.md) and [installation profile](references/installation-profile.md).

Read repository rules, [workflow](references/future-workflow.md), [metadata](references/workflow-metadata.md), selected task questions, current documentation and task-relevant source/tests. Use scripts/workflow-state.py select: highest priority wins, ties follow document order; exact IDs/names never fall back. A blocked selection stops. Implement minimal scoped changes and capture findings through intake with root/direct-parent context. Perform authorized validation and review, update current documentation, then complete with individual acceptance/source evidence. Required unrun checks prevent completion. Record authorized commits only after commit creation. Return completed/needs-dependencies/needs-clarification/validation-blocked outcome and captured IDs. Never implement from the queue alone.

Generated prose follows [document rules](references/document-rules.md). No unrelated changes, implicit permission or source/sibling dependency. Read [development practices](references/development-practices.md) for test-oracle and behavior-preservation decisions.

Use focused behavior, component and API fixtures promptly. Browser checks cover actual routing, hydration, storage, service-worker lifecycle, layout, keyboard focus and accessibility when relevant. Verify exact server/build identity and browser policy; mock or screenshot evidence alone never establishes integration. Deployment and physical-device evidence remain separate. Read [Web development](references/web-development.md) for server identity, failure states and browser/hosted evidence.
