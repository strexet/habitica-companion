# Testing

## Application topology

`tests/Habitica.Domain.Tests/`, `tests/Habitica.Rules.Tests/`, `tests/Habitica.Api.Tests/`, `tests/Habitica.Storage.Tests/` and `tests/Habitica.Application.Tests/` contain xUnit domain, calculation, API, storage and orchestration checks. `tests/Habitica.WebApp.Tests/` uses bUnit for Razor components, page behavior and session state. `tests/Functions/` uses the Node test runner.

After the prerequisites and build in [build-and-release.md](build-and-release.md):

```sh
dotnet test Habitica.sln -m:1 -nodeReuse:false
node --test tests/Functions/*.test.mjs
```

Default checks require no live Habitica credentials. [ai-app-testing.md](ai-app-testing.md) owns browser/UI guidance. Diagnostics live checks, live mutations, deployments and real accounts require applicable authorization. Documentation migration runs no application build, application tests or live-service checks.

## Planning validation

```sh
python3 .agents/skills/skill-tree-process-future-pending/scripts/validate-future-document.py skill-tree/documents/future.md --strict --format json
python3 .agents/skills/skill-tree-repo-documentation-audit/scripts/validate-repository-documentation.py . --format json
python3 .agents/skills/skill-tree-implement-next-future-task/scripts/select-prioritized-task.py skill-tree/documents/future.md --format json
python3 .agents/skills/skill-tree-repo-documentation-audit/scripts/workflow-state.py index .
git diff --check
```

Task selection follows current priority, dependencies and unresolved questions. Metadata validation checks manifest paths/hashes, the installed skill catalog, index agreement, dependency closure and checkpoint identities without changing state. Structural validation and indexed state consistency never establish implementation readiness, external compatibility or completed acceptance. The strict prose validator applies separately; inherited prose findings require scoped cleanup and remain audit coverage gaps.

Prose lint reports located errors and review warnings. `--warnings-as-errors` or repository `--strict` elevates warnings for strict qualification. Scoped plan validation avoids rewriting unrelated current-state prose.

## Canonical workspace persistence fixtures

`tests/browser/workspace-storage.html` is a synthetic, test-only browser fixture outside the PWA build. Serve the fixture with only the real storage module and pinned Dexie vendor asset on a dedicated local origin. The fixture seeds schema 1, imports the real schema-2 module, injects a quota failure through the browser IndexedDB API, races revision-controlled writes and checks reload persistence. The fixture origin must remain separate from the app origin; no real account data or credentials belong in the fixture. C# storage tests qualify interop arguments, scoped identity and strict journal parsing; application fixtures qualify recovery and restore conflicts.
